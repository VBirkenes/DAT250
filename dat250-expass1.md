I struggled a bit with adding maven to my JAVA_HOME variable. However, I downloaded maven via Homebrew instead. That was much easier.

I validated that the software development environment was working by following the Heroku tutorial. Furthermore, I updated my IDE (IntelliJ) so that it is up to date.

I did not encounter any problems when following the Heroku tutorial.
