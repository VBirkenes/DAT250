# Experiment 2: REST API for TODO-items

I did not encounter any technical problems when installing Postman.

Code can be found here: https://github.com/VBirkenes/RestAPIExercise

I used Spark/Java counter service as my starting point. I found it difficult to use IDs in my url, hence I made the CRUD operations using the body of the request. I used Postman to test the operations, they all worked.
